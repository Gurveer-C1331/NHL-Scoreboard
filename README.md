# NHL-Scoreboard
This project displays scoreboards for various ongoing NHL games. Before the game, the scoreboard will display the game's start time and team records. Additionally, the list of channels that will broadcast the game is featured. During the game, the score and shots on goal (SOG) are shown. This project allowed me to learn how to use and integrate an API into a project. This project was made possible by the NHL's API at https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/schedule.
